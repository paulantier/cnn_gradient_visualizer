The goal of this repository is to show the different activations in a CNN network.

This repo is plug and play, and provides a small code to transform CIFAR10 into .npy files that are easier to put in VRAM and allow a faster training time.
Then, it takes random images from the test dataset and shows the average gradient activation for each neuron.
